          <p>
            Planning a trip sounds exciting, but in reality it’s a messy and time-consuming process. 
            Most people have to jump between Google Maps, Notes, and random spreadsheets just to figure out what to do each day. 
            It’s easy to overbook a day, miss a place that’s closed, or end up walking way more than expected. 
            We noticed that there isn’t really one simple tool that helps organize all this information in a flexible way. 
            This can make travel especially difficult for people with mobility limits or tighter budgets who need to plan efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some travel apps like <a href="https://www.tripit.com/" target="_blank">TripIt</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.wanderlog.com/" target="_blank">Wanderlog</a> try to help, 
            but they focus more on collecting bookings or showing lists rather than helping people actually balance time, distance, and costs. 
            Most of them also require logging in or storing your trip on a server, which isn’t ideal if you just want to plan privately or offline. 
            We want to create a lightweight, local web app that keeps all data on your device while letting you easily see what fits into each day. 
            Our project aims to make trip planning more practical, inclusive, and less stressful.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            Our app welcomes a wide range of users who want to plan trips efficiently—especially first-time visitors and
            time-pressed families who benefit from a structured plan—as well as students and travelers who want a quick, 
            personalized itinerary without creating an account or juggling multiple tabs. To ensure inclusivity and minimize 
            negative impacts on minority groups, we will provide screen-reader support, a color-vision-deficiency–
            friendly theme, accessible contrast, and clear text labels (never color alone).
        </p>
        <p>
          The web application contains four interactive sections that together enhance the trip-planning experience:
        </p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Itinerary Planner:</strong> A calendar interface where users can create schedules by adding events with a specific date and time (exact 
            hour or morning/afternoon) and rating each attraction from one to five stars. The flight time will be included based on users' input flight number / exact
            flight time. If the flight number is provided, the app will attach a link to the flight from 
            <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL281" target="_blank">
              FlightAware
            </a>  
            so users can keep track of the flight info.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Map Visualization:</strong> An interactive map that displays all selected attractions with pins and 
            draws daily routes once an itinerary is finalized. Users will be directed to this map when clicking on the location in the itinerary planner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Interaction:</strong> A section where users can like, save, and share itineraries with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attraction Information:</strong> A searchable database of attractions with brief introductions sourced 
            from an online travel database.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The app manages user-generated 
          itinerary data (destinations, timing, preferences, and notes) and integrates external data through 
          <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/University+of+Washington,+Seattle,+WA/Space+Needle,+400+Broad+St,+Seattle,+WA+98109/@47.6337957,-122.3680465,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x54901492f492ee53:0xc49de620ee4a0b02!2m2!1d-122.3081762!2d47.6516448!1m5!1m1!1s0x5490151f4ed5b7f9:0xdb2ba8689ed0920d!2m2!1d-122.3492774!2d47.6205063?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">
            Google Maps links
          </a> 
          that open in a new tab, ensuring seamless navigation.  
        </p>         
        <p>
          We chose this project because trip planning is often fragmented and time-consuming, involving multiple searches 
          for attraction descriptions, sample itineraries, and travel methods across different platforms. Our app simplifies 
          this process by combining all these tasks into a single, interactive space. Users can input their travel details, 
          immediately generate an organized daily schedule, and iteratively adjust their plans with real-time feedback. 
          The client-side design allows travelers to store progress locally, avoid paywalls or login barriers, and share 
          itineraries through simple links. By streamlining trip creation while emphasizing accessibility and inclusivity, our 
          app provides a structured, efficient, and user-friendly solution to one of the most common travel challenges.
